# php

now wanna learn how to run a php file 
first open your terminal or cmd then direct to your php file directories
then run "php -S localhost:8000 -t ." to start your server
then go to your browser and type localhost:8000/yourfileName 

php commands:{
    1:echo "": to print
    2:var_dump() to show you its type
    3:to set a variable we should use $: like $name= cyrus  -> echo "hello $name" >> hello cyrus
    4:assignments are same as other languages like "=" , ">=" and so. 
    5: for array we should use [] or ();
    6: continue vs break . break is completely exit the loop. continue is only skip the condition
    7:for function we should use function NameOfFunc() { your code inside }
    

}
